> "Against our will, our souls are cut off from truth."

Truth, yes, and justice, self-control, kindness... Important to keep this is mind. It will make you more patient with other people.

## Reflection

This is derived from Epictetus, who himself was paraphrasing Plato's _Sophist_. Marcus expands the thought to say that not only are we blind to truth but, indeed, all of the rational traits that Marcus finds valuable.

Essentially, other humans do not know how to live in a way that aligns with Nature (as Stoics defined it, not the same as the natural world). But if you gave them the choice, they would wish that they could, because human nature is essentially good.

Therefore, how can you look at these failings with disdain? What we are seeing is the humanity failing, yes. But **striving**, underneath that failure.

It would make equal sense to be frustrated for a handicapped individual for trying to re-learn to walk.
