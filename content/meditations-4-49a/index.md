## Meditations 4.49a

> 'It's unfortunate that this has happened'

No. It's fortunate that this happened and I've remained unharmed by it - not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn't violate human nature?

...

So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is a great good fortune.

## Reflection

This is a great example of the [optimistic mindset that I advocate for](/../journal-on-realism). This is the type of optimism that is empowering instead of debilitating or naive. Applying the correct for of optimism allows one to endure hardships gracefully, even gratefully.

The ability to appreciate the suffering in life must be one of the keys to creating an overall life of happiness. After all, who doesn't want to be antifragile in suffering?

Imagine a muscle. Isn't it amazing that it gets stronger from being challenged? From being broken down, again and again? Imagine if you got stronger from suffering. Instead of it breaking you,it always made you into a better person. This is the first step towards that process.
