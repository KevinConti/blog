A lot of people get really hung up on motivation and self-discipline. 

I know it feels good to imagine a life where you are completely unswayed by the new season of your favorite show on Netflix, or the release of the next Call of Duty, or whatever other vice you may have… But the truth is, that day is never going to come. 

You’ve probably tried to overcome procrastination before — I know that I have. You set up a website blocker on your computer, tell yourself that you won’t check your phone as much throughout the day, and so on and so forth. But yet here you are.

Okay, I’ll stop making you feel bad about yourself. The truth is, you were set up to fail. 

All the productivity books out there ignore a HUGE factor that determines how successful your attempts are. 

I’ve read every book out there: The Now Habit, Getting Things Done, The ONE Thing, I can go on and on. For the most part, they skip this factor. At the very least, it hasn’t been addressed nearly enough. For me, there has been only one thing that has CONSISTENTLY allowed me to elevate my productivity.

Before you’ll believe me though, I need to argue against both motivation AND self-discipline.

**Why Motivation Won’t Help You**

This has been discussed time and time again, but I need to repeat it here: Motivation is garbage.

You can’t rely on motivation to be productive. It’s too fleeting of a thing, and it leaves you just when you need it most. I have no doubt that you’ve experienced this time and time again. Motivation feels great when you have it, and it definitely pushes you into action, but the second you rely on it to get your work done, you’ll fail when you don’t have it. When you find that inevitable obstacle that feels frustrating, insurmountable, or just downright boring, motivation fades away. 

This is when most people try to turn to self-discipline. I think that this is closer to the mark, but it has the same failings, as I’ll discuss next…

**Why Self-Discipline Won’t Help You**

Okay, the heading of this section is a little misleading. If you could just take a shot of self-discipline, it would help you. But that’s not how it works. For whatever reason, people understand that you can’t just be motivated whenever it is convenient for you. But at the same time, why do we treat discipline as something that is 100% there once you’ve trained it? Outside of some book authors (conveniently pushing the very same books that promote self-discipline), I’ve yet to meet anyone who claims that they have developed self-discipline to near-perfection. 

_The truth is, self-discipline still requires willpower to work!_

It’s true. It certainly takes less willpower than relying on feeling motivated/inspired does, but it still takes willpower. 

And the science behind willpower is depressing. Willpower, scientists have found, starts out high in the beginning of the day, and quickly falls as you are forced to use it throughout the day. And even worse, we’re forced to spend far more willpower than we realize on even the smallest of choices. Did you eat healthy and get a salad for lunch instead of the cheeseburger? Goodbye willpower. 

So, if we can’t rely on motivation and we can’t rely on willpower, what can we rely on?

**The Solution: Engagement**

Some studies have been done on just how potent our environment is in how productive we are. Their conclusion has unanimously been that we do not pay NEARLY enough attention to this issue. 

Here are my recommendations for how to be productive, with each item being listed from most effective in increasing your productivity to least productive:

1.  Buy a cheap flip phone and a sim card adapter (you’ll likely need a nano-sim to standard sim adapter). On work days, put your sim card in the flip phone. Don’t even bring the smart phone out, keep it sealed away for the day. No more Facebook, Reddit, Snapchat, or other mindless browsing. I expect that the average person who commits to this will find three more hours per day of productive work just by not having an easy outlet to procrastinate in.
2.
