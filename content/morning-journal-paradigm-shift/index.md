## A potentially life-altering mindset

I say potentially because I haven't had enough time to put this into practice to see if it works, but so far it seems to be a very powerful way of prioritizing!

**1) Find the thing that you've been secretly avoiding because of how frightening it is.**

Agreeing to give a talk, going out on a first date, asking for help or feedback in an area where you feel insecure are all great examples, but it will be different for each person on each day.

> Personal example: Creating a community for people with Autism to collaborate and share business advice ([Autrepreneurs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2488855847811430/)) despite not part of the community which I'm trying to serve.

**2) Once you've found the thing, figure out what action you could take now to work towards it.**

> Personal example: For the community, I could start filling it with content and posting it publicly, against my fear of perfectionism. I could also start the blog (not public yet: [autrepreneurs.club](https://www.autrepreneurs.club))

**3) Ask yourself: Where does this fall on the [pareto spectrum](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-pareto-principle-the-8020-rule/)?**

Is this in the 20% of things that will give me 80% of the results?

Or is this in the 80% that has to get done in order to enable the 20%?

> Personal example: Posting content to autrepreneurs is essential. At this point, it is in my 20%. However, creating a blog, especially developing it myself, lies in the 80% category.

**4) If it's in the important 20% category, focus on doing it with as much quality and effort as possible! Otherwise, figure out what you can do to minimize the time you'll spend on it.**

> Personal Example: For creating the blog, I can use something that is plug-and-play, like a wordpress or drupal site, and switch it out for something custom in the future. For the content, I should try to write a really good article at least three times this week.

Try this out for yourself, just for one day, and let me know how it goes!
