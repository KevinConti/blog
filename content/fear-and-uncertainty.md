## It's interesting how entrepreneurship seems to be, to a large degree, a battle over your own emotions

It happens everywhere. 

Post asking your potential customers for their opinion? 

_Afraid that they will respond in a way that will invalidate your business._

Ask for feedback on your website?

_Anxiety that people will think your design is horrible_

Launch a product?

_Will anyone even care? Or worse, will they hate it?_

These are problems that most people don't have to face, that we face daily when trying to build our own companies. 

Learning to harden myself to these is a constant process.
