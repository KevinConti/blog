This past week, I published my first content marketing article to [the CoderNotes blog](https://codernotes.io/blog). I spent a decent amount of time on the article, titled [How to Take Coding Notes](https://codernotes.io/blog/how-to-take-coding-notes "How to Take Coding Notes"). I even put pictures in!

I'm not sure how well it's going to do, but from what ahrefs tells me, there is about 300 monthly searches for the keyword "coding notes". My goal is to reach number 1 on google for this keyword, and hopefully get a large bite of that traffic. More importantly, I'm hoping to learn a lot from this experiment. I really want to understand what it takes to create a top-ranking google page. Is writing good content enough? How many backlinks do I have to generate?

I'm treating this like just like I do with learning a new framework in programming. I'm building a "Hello World" app, and seeing how difficult it would be to deep-dive into this project.

I'm also kinda split-testing this, because I have another article that also targets that keyword. For that one, I'm **not** doing any backlink building. I'll update this post in a couple months, when we see how this experiment played out!
