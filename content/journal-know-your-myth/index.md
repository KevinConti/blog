## Reflection

This quote has become more and more ingrained in my mind as I think about it. It does feel true that I am living a myth, and that I need to be aware of it.

To me, that myth feels something like the hero's journey combined with the journey to adulthood.

The hero spends his time working towards slaying demons, trying to overcome his challenge while all the while knowing that he has a greater challenge to face - he must overcome something within himself if he is to succeed.

In a sense, who he is must change, must die, in order for a version of him to succeed.

I feel this very strongly with my anxiety. I must gain control over it if I am to be able to start this business. I must be confident in sharing the idea with the world, and willing to shake off the laughs and criticisms that inevitably follow.

That is my greater demon, the one I haven't figured out how to defeat yet.
