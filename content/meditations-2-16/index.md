## Meditations 2.16:

**The human soul degrades itself:**

1. Above all, when it does its best to become an abscess, a kind of detached growth on the world. To be disgruntled at anything that happens is a kind of secession from Nature, which comprises the nature of all things.

2. When it turns its back on another person or sets out to do it harm, as the souls of the angry do.

3. When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain.

4. When it puts on a mask and does or says something artificial or false.

5. When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be random and disconnected: even the smallest things ought to be directed towards a goal. But the goal of rational beings is to follow the rule and law of the most ancient communities and states.

## Reflection:

**How to fail at life:**

1. To take exclusively from society, without giving in return
  
  1a. To treat loss of material success or fortune as a bad thing

2. To shut off from human connection, _in large or small moments_, through anger or through withdrawal

3. To rely on dopamine and seratonin, to be obsessed with pleasure

  3a. Or, the inverse, to be consumed by pain

4. To lie in any thing. A lack of **radical honesty**

5. To not apply oneself towards a goal in all actions, including small ones.
