## Meditations 7.49

> Look at the past - empire succeeding empire - and from that, extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from the rhythm of events.

> Which is why observing life for forty years is as good as a thousand. Would you really see anything new?

## Reflection

It's amazing that Marcus, the emperor of Rome, was able to understand that the empire was just a temporary reality. The first part of this quote is poignant to those who live in America. But one worth remembering.

The second paragraph speaks to me. Can't we see all of the good in the world with forty years of life? I may only have that long to live. Couldn't I find serenity in close friends, love, ambition, success, in all that time? Wouldn't I see my fair share of heartache, despair, frustration, and guilt? The specifics may change, but the experience that lies underneath them stay universal. I find some modicum of serenity in the fact that I could experience that all, even if my time on the Earth ends early.

And who knows, it could end today. I should not take 40 years for granted.
