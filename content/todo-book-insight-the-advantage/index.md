Notes

Built to last includes the core concept of "core purpose"

> At its core, accountability is about having the courage to confront someone about their deficiencies and then to stand in the moment and deal with their reaction, which may not be pleasant. It is a selfless act, one rooted in a word that I don't use lightly in a business book: _love_. To hold someone accountable is to care about them enough to risk having them blame you for pointing out their deficiencies.

> A VP of a davision decided that more conflict was necessary on the team. Unfortunately, they were having a hard time getting people to engage in it. This is typical.

> So the VP put in place two formal rules.

> First, if people remained silent during discussions, he would interpret that as disagreement. People quickly realized that if they didn't weigh in, a decision could not be made. Second, at the end of every discussion, the CP would go around the room and ask every memver of his team for a formal commitment to the decision.

> These simple rules changed the nature of their meetings and increased healthy conflict almost immediately. This would not have happened had the VP simply told his team that they should engage in more conflict.
