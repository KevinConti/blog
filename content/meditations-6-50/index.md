## Meditations 6.50

> Do your best to convince them. But act on your own, if justice requires it. If met with force, then fall back on acceptance and peaceability. Use the setback to practice other virtures.

> Remember that our efferts are subject to circumstances, you weren't aiming to do the impossible.

> "Aiming to do what then?"

> To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accomplished.

## Reflection

It's a great feeling when you have convinced someone to your way of thinking. Perhaps you worded a thought so perfectly, and they were so open to the consideration, that they immediately saw the error of their ways and now fully align with you.

But that rarely happens.

Instead, it's best to be authentic to your thoughts, but know that it is unlikely they will have a change of heart. In knowing this, you will approach conversations from a place of kindness, instead of a place of needing to 'win'.

And when they refuse to agree with you (even at their own peril), practice being content with the fact that you tried, and succeeded in trying. Therefore, you have succeeded in your goal.
