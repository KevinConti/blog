## Meditations 4.18

> The tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think. Or do.Only what *you* do.

> (Is this fair? Is this the right thing to do?)

> Not to be distracted by their darkness. To run straight for the finish line, unwavering.

## Reflection

This is the tranquility of honesty. To turn fully inward like this (see meditations 4.3 below) allows us to find serenity, because we lose all attachment to things outside of our control. To focus only on our own action focuses us on the *intentional* level instead of the outcome level.

## Meditations 4.3 (first part)

> People try to get away from it all - to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like.

> By going within.
