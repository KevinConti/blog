Someone recently told me,

> I have been struggling with this recently as well. I have been focusing on a problem. Doing lots of conversations with potential people that have the problem. I keep feeling like I am running into road blocks where it seems like there isn't a great problem to solve. Its not worth solving. Seems like it is hard to find the right people that have the problem.

I liked my response, so I figured I'd share it with you.

You're right, it's hard to find problems.

However, saying "there are no problems anymore" is wrong. You know it's wrong. If it was right, no one could start a successful business.

I know it's frustrating when you learn that a problem isn't worth solving. Another way to look at it, however, is to realize that you have just saved yourself tens or hundreds of hours of wasted time! By recognizing it was a problem not worth solving, you'll be finding a good problem that much quicker.

Two good frameworks for finding if a pain is bad enough:

1. Use the Eisenhower Matrix. Find a pain that is both urgent and important. These are golden for an entrepreneur, but hardest to find. Second-best, find a pain that is important, but not urgent. You'll have more work in selling the thing, but it's still a viable pain.
2. Find a pain that can be solved 10x quicker or 10x cheaper. Keeping this frame of reference allows you to quickly identify which pains are really bad.
