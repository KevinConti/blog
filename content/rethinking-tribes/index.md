## I think I'm putting Tribes on hold.

It's not a decision I make easily. I've been working on Tribes for something like three or four months now. I wake up at 5AM, eat a quick breakfast, and work from 6 until I need to leave for work at 8:45. For a little under three hours a day, I've been tackling this project, trying to get a grasp of how much work it would take a single developer to launch.

In that time I've made wireframes, learned design from scratch (something I considered basically impossible for a developer just a few weeks ago), analyzed and re-analyzed the business model, developing the entire project to a point where I think it's truly a fantastic idea.

But I'm not sure, and there are a couple things that are making me uneasy about this project.

## 1) I've been building it in hiding

I've been feeling uneasy about this fact. I love the feeling of waking up before most, tackling my most important work at the literal crack of dawn, having achieved more to reach towards my goal by 9AM than anyone else I know, as though I'm the next "started in his garage" story.

But the downside to this process has been that I'm not getting enough feedback.

I don't have anyone telling me that it's a bad idea (regardless of the truth of that statement), offerring that critical feedback, essential for a business, because not enough people are even aware of what I'm building.

I'm not having conversations with people who could use it, because I'm not engaged in the community.

I'm building this in a "fragile" way. I've created this idea, this idea of an amazing service for individuals with low-functioning autism, that exists only in my head, and I'm trying to build it before knowing if people would use it. How easy it is to shatter an idea that has never truly been validated.

Isn't it better to work in reverse? I should engage with people, identify why they can't solve the problem themselves, discover the true pain points behind the problem, and iteratively come up with a solution from there?

Perhaps those engagements would lead me right back to the same idea, but there's a good chance they lead in a different, more impactful, direction.

All these issues boil down to the next point...

## 2) I can't tell if it passes "The Mom Test"

_The Mom Test_ has nothing to do with my mom, [it's the name of a book.](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Mom-Test-Audiobook/B07RHWCHD8?qid=1561635932&sr=1-1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=QWPTK25BYR4JQYJ3EE43&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1) The book made a compelling point, freezing me in my tracks, by saying that people tend to accidentally lie to you when you ask for feedback on your business idea.

Here are the two reasons why people lie to you (on accident):

**Reason 1: People aren't honest due to social pressure**

I thought that I was handling this just fine by demanding feedback from friends and family, asking questions like:

_"What problems do you see? Be honest with me, please."_

or

_"Can you please give me your negative feedback?"_

Good questions, but I'm not sure if they are truly enough to get people to speak their mind anymore. People are just too damn polite sometimes.

My friend Ian told me yesterday, _"When asking for feedback, you need to ask someone to be honest three times before they'll tell you the truth."_ Wise words.

It's so difficult to ask for feedback on a business idea. Your need for validation interferes with the idea's need to be chisled into a better version of itself. What is the right balance between resilience in negative feedback, and allowing that feedback to shape your idea?

I'm not sure.

**Reason 2: People are bad at knowing if something is a good idea, _even if they are the target audience for it!_**

You probably agree that people don't necessarily know if something is a good idea if they are not the target audience. After all, why should they have a better idea than you, when you've spent hours and hours researching the issue?

I'm not going to waste time on that side. But what about target customers? Don't they know exactly what they want?

To apply [Betteridge's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines), no.

For reasons I won't elaborate on here, people make decisions based on identity. But, more perniciously, when you ask someone _if they WOULD like something_, they answer that question based on an imagined version of **future identity**, which is who they would like to be in the future, a highly unrealistic view of themselves.

Which is why you can easily imagine this conversation:

> After describing the product...

>"Hey, can you imagine yourself using this thing?"

> "Yes! Oh my God I've been waiting all my life for this!"

> "Okay, actually there are three other competitors of this thing. Have you ever used them?"

> "Oh... no... I guess I never have looked into it before."

> "So you're saying you'd really like it, but when you think back you've never actually tried to see if it existed?"

> "...Yea"

The feedback is a lie. But it's an accidental lie, because they think it's the truth.

**So, how to handle this issue?**

If people are lying to themselves, how the hell do we get useful information out of them?

Well, _The Mom Test_ suggests that you ask for people's _past_ habits, and infer from that if your idea would work.

In other words, discover their true identity. Not the identity they imagine having in the future.

Imagine you wanted to make a better version of email, and you want to know if people are interested. Here are some good questions to ask:

> "Do you struggle with managing your email? What solutions have you tried to solve this issue?"

> "Have you ever tried a solution other than email, such as moving conversations to another tool like Slack or in-person?"

> "Can you give a specific example of a time where email caused an expensive miscommunication for your team?"

Notice how none of these involve predicting the future.

Maybe you'll get encouraging answers from these questions, learning that people have tried many solutions to eliminate email, not finding one good enough, and have many specific examples of email causing screw-ups costing thousands of dollars.

But maybe you won't.

The point is, these types of questions actually tell you something useful, whereas asking "Would you use a better email?" actually tells you **literally nothing**

![](point.jpg)

The point is, I've been asking the wrong questions, to the wrong people, for the wrong reasons. The feedback I've gotten, while exciting, is colored by how excited I am about the project. People can't help but get excited. And it's not a good sign when, a week later, some of these people come back hesitant. Does that mean I'm inspiring them with a vision, but when they come back down to earth they have real concerns?

Or is this an internal struggle that I'm projecting outward? Maybe I just feel the project is going to fail horrendously, and this is just me trying to save face?

I'm not sure, but what I am sure of is that I need to spend more time on the ground with people who actually would use this product.

# My proposed solution

Okay, here's what I'm thinking: Put Tribes, temporarily, on hold for now. Don't talk about it, don't sell it as a solution, hold off on developing it and keep it in the back of my mind.

Instead, I want to start a blog.

> Wow, that's boring.

Yea, it kinda is. But it's more useful, for now. I need to build a community of people who care about this problem. The blog will be advice on starting a business for people with Autism, with a core focus on lower-functioning autism.

I think I'm actually a really good candidate to talk about this subject. I'm well-versed in the business space, I know Autism and the struggles that surround it, and I'm an armchair expert on subjects like productivity and habits. The combination of the three will be really valuable to people, even though I don't have the credibility of being a Mark Cuban or something.

The blog itself will be absolutely free, 100% about building the community. No ads, no sales, nothing at all.

As it grows, I just want to explore people's problems there. What stops people from starting a business? What pain points are people running into? What can I do to improve the process?

Then, once I really understand the struggle that prevents people from creating their own companies, I will make the best product out there on the market for them. I want to deliver so much value that people are blown away.

I think this is so much better, because when I finally do find out what would help people the most, I'll already have a group of people who it will help! And it will be "built in public" right in front of them on that group, so feedback will come quickly and openly.

Well, it's 8:45. Time for my other job.

**So, what do you think?**
