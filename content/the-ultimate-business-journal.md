Last Updated 03/05/2020

I am currently in the process of getting away from a paid forum that I'm a part of, where I was keeping a journal about the progress of codernotes.io. Since I don't want to lose access to all of that content, I'm moving it here:

**Jan 22, 2020:**

Welcome all,  
  
Here I'll be documenting my journey into SaaS. My main goal with this thread is to be a place to gather great feedback, and hold myself accountable to DELIVERING. Thanks for taking the time to read along with my journey.  
  
**Where I'm Starting**  
Currently building a SaaS web application - a learning tool for professional developers to help you maximize the knowledge you gain and keep from online courses/training. Have you taken a coding course online, gone through all of the examples, and three months later your remember nothing about it? This is the problem I'm trying to solve.  
  
**Where I'm at Today**  
I've just posted in the Feedback section - [Am I Disobeying the Commandment of Entry?](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/am-i-disobeying-the-commandment-of-entry-help-me-decide-which-client-segment-to-pursue.93105/) - and would love your feedback.  
From a development standpoint, I've been deep-diving into a new database technology called Google Firebase, and evaluating it for implementation as the backend of my app. My frontend is being written in Elm, for any functional programming enthusiasts out there!  
  
**Where I'm Headed**

1. Get feedback from the three market segments I identified in the post linked above. Would they buy a tool like this? Does it have _perceived value_? If not, what is missing?
2. Finish MVP of product rapidly - get core functionality working and share with alpha users

Let's do this!

**January 24, 2020:**

Another possible market segment I've been thinking about yesterday and today... another one to explore on my list.  
  
Currently, my market segmentation (to explore) look like this:  
  
**1) End-users**  
Motivated professionals who want to maximize learning and retention while learning new coding concepts and syntax  
  
**2) Content/Course Creators**  
Individuals who create courses on websites such as Pluralsight, Udemy, or their own personal website, who want to increase the value of their course offering.  
  
**3) Enterprise**  
Companies who are already spending money on learning materials for their developers, and want to make sure that they money they are spending is being converted into valuable knowledge that drives the business forward.  
  
_The new market segment is somewhat of a mix between two and three... The content platforms themselves!_  
  
**4) Content Platforms**  
Websites such as Pluralsight, FrontEndMasters, and Udemy, who (may?) be interested in a strategic partnership - AKA a discount for their members. The bigger companies could also be a possible buyer long-term.  
  
_What do you all think of #4? Is it worth exploring? Personally, I'm pretty excited by the thought._

**January 24, 2020:**

So, my goal is to do a weekly recap every Friday. Have it listed on my calendar for 10AM so, despite having just started this thread Wednesday, I'll give my recap.  
  
**_What did I do this week?_**  
_1) Personal Work_  
This week, I focused on starting to build in public. I have been consistently posting in front of other entrepreneurs on this forum, as well as indiehackers and various private slack groups I am a member of, in order to solicit feedback and generate some momentum and accountability for myself. So far, the feedback I've gotten from the forum has been great, and I'm looking forward to being continually challenged by you all.  
  
_2) Product / Business_  
More importantly, what did I do surrounding my product? I posted an important thread: [Am I Disobeying The Commandment Of Entry?](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/am-i-disobeying-the-commandment-of-entry-help-me-decide-which-client-segment-to-pursue.93105/#post-846632) Thankfully, MJ offered some great feedback, which is solidifying my decision to explore all the segments simultaneously.  
  
After reaching that conclusion, I've moved on to customer research. I am an advocate for the methods described in the book [The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492180742/?tag=tff-amazonparser-20), which says to NEVER ask leading questions during this research. For example, asking _"Hey, do you like my idea?"_ is the WORST question you can ask! Instead, ask for these things:

* How have you handled this problem in the past?
* What solutions have you looked for to solve this problem?
* What are you doing now to mitigate this pain?

As such, I've started to ask those questions to developers, the first customer segment I'm exploring. The final conclusion is still pending, but here's what I've found so far:

* Maximizing learning is a difficult task for developers
* The developers who are the most motivated are those whose skills most directly are correlated to their income. Freelancers / entrepreneurs / consultants care more than some dev in a huge company
* Ways they try to increase their learning speed:
  * Using applied learning (#1 most common) - learning something then turning around and implementing it
  * Teaching what you've learned - via blogging or other
  * Taking notes - Using a program like Evernote or Notion

I'll write more posts to conclude on this research, but the above feels exciting to me. I'm confident that what I'm building is a complement to this, **the challenge will be to POSITION the product so it doesn't compete with applied learning, but instead is viewed as a way to do it more efficiently**  
  
_3) Technical_  
Finally, what did I do from a development perspective?

* Created and got feedback on a marketing page for the Developer/End-User customer segment on Indie Hackers - and was thankfully told to kill it.

It was a horrible template and looks disgusting. Love that I'm getting that kind of feedback! Sometimes, it just takes someone making a comment for us to get out of our head and realize that we are blinded by [the IKEA effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-shaping-us/201910/the-ikea-effect). Before, I was using unbounce. I've moved to a new service, which has a much nicer template!

* Learned about [hasura](https://hasura.io/) as an alternative to Firebase

I am super excited to do some preliminary research to determine if it would be worth changing! The cost to change this early on is cheap, and it seems like I may be able to get to MVP much quicker with this change.

* Learn advanced Elm techniques

I'm still a beginner when it comes to the Elm language, although I'm in love with it, so I'm spending time building up my skills here as well.  
  
**What did I learn this week?**

* Positioning will be a challenge for this product
* Working in public is incredibly important for holding myself accountable, as well as to get valuable feedback
* (Technical) There is an alternative to Firebase that I need to explore

  
**What am I doing next week?**

* Deep-dive into customer pain exploration - all four market segments. This is #1 priority
* Investigate Hasura for tech stack

**January 28, 2020:**

Doing some more problem validation today. Finished [The Problem](https://codingcourseproblem.landen.co/) , which is a landing page that tries to nail the customer pain point I'm targeting. So far, I've spread it to some devs I know personally (whose opinions I trust the least due to our personal relationship), as well as multiple entrepreneurship threads for advice / feedback, especially from devs.  
  
I'll be tallying up the total quantitative response later, once the experiment has run its course.  
  
I'm thinking of throwing $100 in Google Adwords to get some relevant traffic pointed this way. I have analytics turned on, so I'll be able to get good numbers from that. Does anyone have good ideas about how to generate more traffic to this site besides this?

**February 4, 2020:**

So much to recap about!  
  
Last week, I deep-dove into this potential problem for developers. I had two questions I wanted the answer to:  
  
1) Is this a real problem?  
2) Is this a painful problem?  
  
I was primarily exploring this for end-users, as I realized that although I had four market segments, they all depended on the end-users actually relating to this problem. To handle this, I performed an experiment by making a landing page and sharing it to as many developers as I could.  
  
Landing page: [The Problem](https://codingcourseproblem.landen.co/)  
  
Here are the results:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Feedback Level | Quantity | Notes |
| Neutral | 3 | Wanted a solution proposed |
| Positive - third pain | 4 | Related to only the third pain (Only related to hassle of saving and finding obscure code snippets) |
| Negative - not interested | 4 | Just searches stack overflow. "It's always easy to find what you need" |
| Neutral - does not take online courses | 1 | Developer who doesn't take online courses, and didn't relate to the issue, but was willing to look at the solution once it was made |
| Positive - people with bias (Friends, family, etc) | 3 | Positive feedback on the problem, but biased due to personal relationship |
| Positive | 4 | Related to the website as a whole |
| Positive - Other | 3 | People who did not provide specific feedback, but singed up on the mailing list |

  
  
Feedback by experience

| --- | --- |
| Segment | Feedback (Generalized) |
| Entry and mid-level developers | Positive, related to the pain |
| Senior developers | Negative, did not relate or only related to the third pain |

  
**Conversion Rate Information:**  
Entrepreneur Forums:  
  
While we would expect the lowest conversion rate from here, as people are unqualified leads, these forums consisted of the majority of traffic. Around 80 visits were made to the site from these various locations, and of them there were 4 sign-ups, or around a 5% conversion rate. I think that this is a high number when I was simply asking people for feedback, validation, etc.  
  
Google Adwords:  
For more scientific purposes, I decided to also do a $100 adwords experiment. The final results:

* 58 clicks -> 4 sign ups, or \~6.8% conversion rate

This ad wasn't well-made, it was just a small experiment to get a baseline for future experiments. Although I'm not happy with the CAC through this channel, it's good to know that interest was created through hands-off methods  
  
Friends / Qualified Leads:  
  
The final place I looked to was friends and qualified leads. These are people I know personally who fit the positive user segment I identified above: An entry-to-mid level developer who enjoy online learning. These results can be biased, but this had a 75% conversion rate in the relatively small sample size.  
  
Conclusion

* Most devs who are actively taking coding courses related to this issue
* Devs who are actively taking courses tend to be earlier on in their career
* Experienced devs were more likely to relate to the third pain point (“You need to be able to search the hard parts”)
  * Entry-level devs were no less likely to relate to the third pain point, making this a high potential of a large problem

\---  
  
After creating the experiment, I went and made another webpage for the more generalized problem of code snippet maintenance. For devs out there, I'm sure many of you can related to that feeling of, "Oh crap, how do I do that one 'hello world' level thing in this framework? I always forget".  
  
You can find the webpage here (note, the copy is only a first draft):  
[www.codernotes.io](http://www.codernotes.io/)  
  
As I was creating this page, I realized that I have some sort of disconnect to the problem. It almost felt to general, and I myself couldn't relate to the pain anymore... which means I'm no longer scratching my own itch.  
  
With this in mind, I took a step back. I've answered if people experienced this pain, but were people truly frustrated by this pain? With that in mind, I took to researching more models for how to decide if this was painful enough for people.  
  
My solution: ask the following question  
**Are people already searching for and buying something like this?**  
  
If they are, then you know that it's painful. If they aren't then you either have a brand new idea (expensive to explain to people), or something that people won't pay for (bad idea).  
  
So I did some research, and it appears that there is at least one company working on this problem: cacher.io  
  
In my opinion, their application misses the most important, UVP of why people need the service, and it seems that they are doing well, as their main site advertises 2,500 teams. At a minimum of $20/month, that's $50,000/mo in revenue.  
  
There are some alternatives, but they seem to all be doing far worse than cacher:

So with this in mind, here is my plan:  
1) Publish new landing page with improved copy, compare relative response.  
2) Explore new idea (that I haven't mentioned), compare relative response.  
  
Choose which of the top two is the most viable, and quickly build MVP with single core feature.

**Feb 14, 2020:**

**TLDR: Been grinding hard, slower marketing due to product focus**

* Codernotes.io copy rewritten - to much success.
* Changed pricing plan to a freemium model:
  * Free: Create up to three public snippets per day: $0/mo
  * Pro: Create unlimited public and private snippets: $19/mo
  * Team (For companies): Share code snippets between only members of your team/organization: $99/mo
* Organic interest: 3 free plans, 0 pro plans, 1 team plan. This is without any marketing or sales.
* Active work on developing product: currently around 30-50% completed with the project, aiming to finish dev by start of March, and finish final design by end of March (waiting on TailwindUI)
* Released a podcast: First Time Founder. Available on Spotify, Apple, Google, etc.
  * [First Time Founder](https://firsttimefounder.transistor.fm/)

  
Upcoming Week:

* Create marketing system - funnel, email automation, etc
* Twitter and Google ads to generate interest / signups
* Record and edit podcast (weekly)
* Finish important product features - Auth and Search
* Free Time: Want to build a no-code membership site called Maker'sHelp (or something similar). Users earn 'currency' for getting upvoted for helpful advice, feedback, posts, which they can redeem to post themselves. Create a virtuous cycle.
  * Purpose:
    * I need to be getting more feedback, and I want something like this (give value to get value)
    * Explore viability of no-code tools, forum + membership is great use case (limiting posting may be difficult)
    * Possibility for [fastlane forum](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/) model (PRO to get no ads) if it gets traffic

**Feb 23, 2020:**

Status Report:  
  
Metrics:

* Free beta signups: 5
* Pro beta signups: 1
* Team beta signups: 1

Recap:

* Create marketing system - funnel, email automation, etc
  * **Didn't do this, but committing to engage with this more in the following week**
* Twitter and Google ads to generate interest / signups
  * **Again, moving that to this week**
* Record and edit podcast (weekly)
  * [**Launched!**](https://firsttimefounder.transistor.fm/episodes/kevin-explains-his-new-product) **A huge improvement to episode 1, in my opinion. Up to 20 listens so far.**
* Finish important product features - Auth and Search
  * **Done, CoderNotes is now officially in Alpha!**
* Free Time: Want to build a no-code membership site called Maker'sHelp (or something similar). Users earn 'currency' for getting upvoted for helpful advice, feedback, posts, which they can redeem to post themselves. Create a virtuous cycle.
  * Purpose:
    * I need to be getting more feedback, and I want something like this (give value to get value)
    * Explore viability of no-code tools, forum + membership is great use case (limiting posting may be difficult)
    * Possibility for [fastlane forum](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/) model (PRO to get no ads) if it gets traffic
  * **I didn't get around to this, and I'm re-thinking if it's worth the time. Happy to hear thoughts around this!**

  
  
This week:

* Release podcast episode 3
* Start marketing effort
  * SEO - write two blog posts to generate interests
  * Twitter/Google ads
  * Decide cold email outreach strategy
* Decide on offering alpha to certain people who have signed up for beta to increase feedback
* Decide on releasing MakersHelp as a free software, if it's worth the time
* Add certain core features to product to move it towards beta - but I'm leaning heavier into marketing now that an MVP is released.
