## Meditations 7.63

> When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you'll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them.

> Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they're misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?

## Reflection

When you try to do something publicly, such as to hold your beliefs without acquiescing, or to diverge from the status quo (start a business, for example), you will find criticism from others.

It's best to keep the above in mind, because it reminds you that criticism cannot hurt you unless you let it.

Either realize that their intention is noble, in which case you can forgive them, or that their intention was ignoble, in which case you should feel sorry for them.
